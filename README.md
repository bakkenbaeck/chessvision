# ChessVision

In 2019 we created a physical chessboard scanner, which you can read about [here](https://tech.bakkenbaeck.com/post/chessvision). As a part of the project, we created our own dataset, which weâ€™ve now decided to publish and share - to help others who might be working on similar projects.

## Structure

Under `data` you will find pieces placed under appropriate directory. For example images of black rook under the directory `br`
